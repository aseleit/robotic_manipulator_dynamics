%% ACCEL - Computation of the joint acceleration for two link 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    qdd = accel(rob,q,qd,tau) 
%    qdd = rob.accel(q,qd,tau) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables, their temporal derivatives and applied joint forces/torques 
%    this function computes the joint acceleration. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of two link specific class 
%    q:  2-element vector of generalized 
%         coordinates 
%    qd:  2-element vector of generalized 
%         velocities 
%    tau:  2-element vector of joint 
%         input forces/torques 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    qdd:  [1x2] vector of joint accelerations
