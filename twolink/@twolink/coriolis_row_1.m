%    Crow = coriolis_row_1(rob,q,qd) 
%    Crow = rob.coriolis_row_1(q,qd) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables and their first order temporal derivatives this function computes the

%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of two link specific class 
%    qd:  2-element vector of generalized 
%    q:  2-element vector of generalized 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    Crow:  [1x2] row of the robot Coriolis matrix

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
