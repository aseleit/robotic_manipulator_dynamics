function T0_1 = T0_1(rob,in2)
%% T0_1 - Forward kinematics for the two link arm up to frame 1 of 2. 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    T = T0_1(rob,q) 
%    T = rob.T0_1(q) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a set of joint variables up to joint number 1 the function 
%    computes the pose belonging to that joint with respect to the base frame. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    q:  1-element vector of generalized coordinates. 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    T:  [4x4] Homogenous transformation matrix relating the pose of joint 1 of 2 
%              for the given joint values to the base frame.

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
   




%    This function was generated by the Symbolic Math Toolbox version 8.3.
