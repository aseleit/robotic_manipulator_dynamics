function I = inertia(rob,q)
%% INERTIA - Inertia matrix for the two link arm. 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    I = inertia(rob,q) 
%    I = rob.inertia(q) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables the function computes the 
%    inertia Matrix of the robot. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of two link specific class 
%    q:  2-element vector of generalized 
%         coordinates 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    I:  [2x2] inertia matrix
