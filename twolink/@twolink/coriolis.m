%% CORIOLIS - Coriolis matrix for the two link arm 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    Crow = coriolis(rob,q,qd) 
%    Crow = rob.coriolis(q,qd) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables and their first order temporal derivatives the function computes the 
%    Coriolis matrix of the robot.

%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of two link specific class 
%    qd:  2-element vector of generalized 
%    q:  2-element vector of generalized 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    C:  [2x2] Coriolis matrix
